===Skype, 12:29pm.===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I live in America. My whole family is in Europe. I talk to them every day. See, my brother also lives away from home and he is not the type to keep in touch as often. My parents have always been very involved in our lives and him not investing time in talking to them makes me put extra effort in maintaining a good relationship. I work Monday through Friday, but I use half of my lunch break every day to give my mom and dad every single detail of my day. It makes them happy, you know.</p> <p>My dad started working on some construction project so he is not at home as often when I call on Skype. My mom just retired, so she is always available and ready to fire couple dozen questions at me. And I answer them with a smile on my face.</p> <p>So exactly a week ago, on Monday the 29th of October, I call my mom on Skype. It is 12:29 pm. Both of our cameras are on. </p> <p>“Hey mom! How’s it going?” I gave her the usual greeting.</p> <p>No response. She’s just looking at me. I had a feeling she was looking deep into my soul, I swear. Her pupils looked unusually large. </p> <p>“Mom, can you hear me?” Internet at home isn’t the greatest and sometimes we have connection issues so I thought she couldn’t hear me. “Mom?”</p> <p>“Your brother is dead.”</p> <p>I fucking froze. You know how whenever your phone rings late at night you get a shiver thinking someone you know died? I am a bit of a paranoid person and whenever I call my parents I always try to read their faces right away and see if something’s wrong. This time, something was. </p> <p>“What?!” I yelled. My brother started working on a peacekeeping mission in a troubled region, which always kept me really worried.</p> <p>“He died. You look nice today.” Her expression didn’t change at all. Pupils wide as ever.</p> <p>Now, my mom is a really loving person and I know that if my brother were really dead, she’d be crying her eyes out to say at least. I was thinking that maybe shock made her motionless.</p> <p>“What? Where’s dad?” Tears started pouring down my face.</p> <p>“Oh, he’s at work.”</p> <p>“What the fuck is going on?” Anger came over me. Was she fucking with me? She’d never do that in this kinda fucked up way though. </p> <p>“Your brother. He is dead. And so will you be soon [my name].”</p> <p>I fucking died a little at that moment. My ever-loving mom was sitting there, on the other side of the camera, 5000 miles away, telling me that my only brother is dead, and that I was next. She didn’t show any emotion whatsoever. Then, Skype disconnected. </p> <p>I immediately called my brother. It rang once. It rang twice. Fuck. It rang for the third time. Nothing. He’s gone. He answered.</p> <p>“Yes?”</p> <p>I broke down. I broke down in relief, happiness, and confusion of these events. </p> <p>“You… You’re alive.” I managed to mumble.</p> <p>“What the fuck is up with you man?” He was surprised.</p> <p>“Nothing, bro. I love you. Take care.”</p> <p>I decided to call my mom back and yell at her for playing fucked up games. Skype rang. She answered.</p> <p>“Hey [my name]!” Smile on her face. Emotions.</p> <p>“What is wrong with you?” I was pissed.</p> <p>“Excuse me?” She looked genuinely surprised. </p> <p>“Why would you say those things to me few minutes ago?”</p> <p>“What things? I just signed on?” My mom was either an amazing actress or was telling he truth.</p> <p>“Nev…nevermind. How are you today?” </p> <p>I rushed the conversation so I could analyze these events. Something was wrong. As most of you know, I try to rationalize everything. I couldn’t logically explain this. I wasn’t hallucinating. The only explanation I had was that my mom was fucking with me. But see, I know my mom. She would never do that. Something was off here. However, there was nothing I could do.</p> <p>The next day went well. I called my mom around 1 pm and she was fine. No issues, no weirdness. </p> <p>Then came Wednesday. I dialed her username on my lunch break only to realize it was 12:29pm. Who cares man, that has nothing to do with what happened. She answered.</p> <p>Emotionless face. </p> <p>“Hello there, [name].”</p> <p>“Mom, is this you? Are you messing with me?”</p> <p>“Of course its me baby, what do you mean?” Nothing changed on her face. She wasn’t surprised. Her pupils were so dark that they looked like two holes, even on her low-res webcam. </p> <p>“I don’t know, you’re acting weird…”</p> <p>“You know what’s weird? That when a person dies, the last sense to go is hearing. You will be blind, lose sense of touch, but you will be able to hear. You’ll be bale to hear me.”</p> <p>It disconnected. Needless to say, I was terrified. Terrified of what my mother became. Terrified of these horrors I was hearing. I called back.</p> <p>My real mom answered. She acted normally, oblivious to our previous conversation.</p> <p>I decided not to call at 12:29 pm ever again. And I was good for few days. Then today, I couldn’t handle it anymore. I had to. You would, too. You know you would. I had to know, man. </p> <p>12:29pm. She’s online. It’s ringing.</p> <p>“Hi darling.” She never calls me darling.</p> <p>“Who is this?”</p> <p>“You silly thing, its your momma.” She never calls herself “my momma”.</p> <p>“You’re not my mom. Who the fuck are you?!”</p> <p>Her voice changed. From my mom’s voice to something more scary. Deeper. Almost manly.</p> <p>“You walk out on [name of the street] today after work. Walk out and I will meet you there.” </p> <p>Nobody in my family knows my current street address let alone my work address.</p> <p>“What?”</p> <p>“Just walk out, honey.” I could feel demeaning tone in her/his voice. </p> <p>“Who the fuck are you?” I yelled at whatever that was.</p> <p>“Oh, you’ll soon find out.”</p> <p>“Where’s my mom?”</p> <p>She started laughing. I could see her reach for the keyboard. She winked at me, then disconnected.</p> <p>I am sitting at work right now. My shift ended 30 minutes ago. I am too afraid to walk out and meet whatever became of my mother. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/inaaace"> inaaace </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12p9g0/skype_1229pm/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12p9g0/skype_1229pm/">[81 comments]</a>
===Highway===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This was when I was 16. Me and my best friend have a sleepover every Friday night. When his parents went to bed we would wait an hour or two (1-2 am) and sneak out and go to the gas station. The gas station was a few miles but it was a risky fun adventurous thing to do back then. It was cold this night lightly snowing, about 30 degrees fahrenheit. Ice covered the road. When cars came down the highway (rarely) we jumped over the guard rails so they didn&#39;t see us. We were about a mile into the journey and we see two VERY bright light coming down the highway. As routine we &quot;bailed&quot; and hid from the car. WE heard a loud screech and crash and when i looked up the car was totaled. my stomach sank and I wondered if the person in the car was okay. Me an my friend ran up to the car and looked. there was nothing in the car. Literally. No Stereo no Dashboard no Seats no nothing just a hollow car. having just snowed we looked for footprints. There were none. There was a single flannel jacket and a pair of cracked glasses. We immediately ran home and never spoke about it again</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Opiate420"> Opiate420 </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12p18h/highway/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12p18h/highway/">[5 comments]</a>
===Handprints===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Handprints</p> <p>This happened to me about 4 months ago, and I’ve never really recounted the story to anyone. Didn’t seem like there was a point, as it’s pretty easy to come up with reasonable explanations for this... to a point.</p> <p>At the time I was in grade 10, and it was around the middle of the year. I had been pretty sick for about a week beforehand, and had been home alone for a few days. From memory, this story happened on the fourth day I was sick, but I could be wrong. Me and my mom were the only people living in the house, but of course, she had to go to work. It was okay, I was used to being home alone. It wasn’t that my mom had to work overly long hours, just that she had been pretty casual about how much time I missed from school, so long as I got B’s or higher. </p> <p>It was a pretty nasty head cold. Vomiting, blocked nose, and coughing to the point that i’d basically lost my voice. My time at home was spent playing X-Box and browsing the web, but that’s only while I wasn’t in bed resting. I’d sleep until about midday, at which point hunger would awaken me. </p> <p>I’d just taken a shower, which, with a cold like this, was completely essential if one wanted to function like a regular human being for the rest of the day. After having attempted to somewhat unblock my sinuses, I stepped out. My eyes were sore from the cold already, combined with the shampoo that leaked into them when I was washing my hair, I could hardly see. After drying myself and looking in the mirror, eyes still mostly closed out of pain, I saw that it was completely fogged up. </p> <p>I grunted. Well, attempted to at least. Due to my non-stop coughing what came out was more like a dry, high pitched rasp. I decided to go get dressed in my room. It’s not like I could see anything even if the mirror wasn’t foggy as hell. Hopefully by the time I got back, the mirror would be back to normal and I could perform the normal routine. Brushing my teeth, shaving, that sort of thing. </p> <p>I turned around and stepped out of the bathroom and into the hallway. As I walked, however, something felt wrong. Let me make it clear that I’m not the kind of guy who gets creeped out just by the thought of being alone in an empty house. I actually enjoyed the loneliness. But something felt off here. It was like being watched, but... different. This feeling was made especially bad by my total lack of vision at the time. Shrugging it off, I made my way to my bedroom.</p> <p>I had finished putting on my jeans and having just begun buttoning up my shirt, which took longer than normal due to my eyes being swollen and sore, when I heard a crash coming from down the hallway. After a moment of pure shock and confusion, I ran into the bathroom. I looked around to see what had caused the noise, and saw that most of the bottles of moisturizer and deodorant and other miscellaneous things that sat around the basin, had been knocked onto the floor. i looked around, eyes still slightly sore, and closed up, but could see nothing. “Hello?” I yelled out, not quite sure if I was expecting any sort of response. I half expected laughter due to the ridiculous sound of my voice, hoarse and dry. There was nothing but silence, save for the bottles and toothbrushes still wobbling and spinning slightly on the tiles of the bathroom floor. I sat down on the side of the bath, wanting to collect my thoughts and try to figure out what had happened. That’s when I noticed something odd.</p> <p>The bathroom was still foggy</p> <p>It had been at least 6 minutes since I left the shower, the fog certainly should have died down by now. Even the mirror was still covered in a thick layer of mist. After about 20 seconds of me thinking about what had just happened, and chocking it up to a stiff breeze through the window in my bathroom, but still unable to explain the remaining fog, I stood up to look in the mirror and continued to button up my shirt, still breathing heavily. It was only after i’d finished this that i looked upwards to the top of the mirror. It was then that my heart started to beat fast, real fast.</p> <p>There were handprints at the top of the mirror. Distinct, large, human looking handprints. I tried to calm myself down, telling myself I must have leant against it before I left to get dressed, but they were so high up, I would have remembered reaching that high, and that’s when it hit me. The odd feeling i had earlier, the feeling of being watched, it had only started once i left the shower and subconsciously looked around the room. I observed the handprints closer, and saw something that made my blood run cold, something that i still don’t think i’ve quite recovered from. Something that made me wonder just what was in the room when I left the shower, hiding in plain sight, taking advantage of my then debilitated eyes.</p> <p>The handprints only had 4 fingers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/JayMoondog"> JayMoondog </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12nw40/handprints/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12nw40/handprints/">[63 comments]</a>
===Sophie? (Update to "Awe_files"===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys. This is an update to my last post “Awe_files” First is first, I’d like to thank you all so much for helping me out. I really appreciated all the feedback. As a few of you all requested this is my update. </p> <p>So, I went through and tried to find out more about the files themselves. I got a suggestion to right click the properties of the photographs, to see where they were downloaded from. It turns out, they weren’t downloaded at all. They had been uploaded to my computer from a camera on the twenty second of October, this year, 2012. From what seems like a small probably old point-and-shoot camera. Most of the photos are only 200-500 pixels large (besides the acceptation of a few larger, clearer pictures.) I got the computer on the tenth of October so the idea of it already being on the computer is ruled out. I have a firewall already (Kaspersky 2013). And again, the password is REALLY hard to guess. So, I don’t know about this. </p> <p>As for going to the cops, that’s ruled out for now. They won’t do shit besides arrest me, you guys were right.</p> <p>While investigating the pictures itself, I saw that the pictures seem to be of the same child; A little girl with Dirty blonde hair, green eyes. She’s Caucasian, with a few freckles on her cheeks. And what appears to be a birthmark on her left arm. (Or so it seems in the photographs.) It seems as if this is her childhood. What happened after the last GIF, I don’t know. </p> <p>Now, for the memo. Most of its nonsense/systematic looking stuff. Nothing notable, really. Until the end. The end is all in binary. Fortunate for me, I was thought at the beginning of last year. While unscrambling it, I found something weird, in my opinion. It said “Sophie” and “Soon”. I’ll tell you now, My name’s not Sophie. I don’t know anyone named Sophie. Could it be the girl’s name? The soon part however, I’m quite afraid of. I don’t know when “soon” will be, or what it means at all, honestly. Also, I saw a number that stood out. It said “11:15” in between a couple of letters. It was italicized. But I shouldn’t really stress much about it at the moment. Those are the only weird things I found in the memo.</p> <p>That’s all I really have at the moment. I’ll update when I find out more, I promise. Please, if you know anything? Maybe a missing person? Any answers right now are good ones… Again, thank you all so much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/FlippyDoo13"> FlippyDoo13 </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12ot1z/sophie_update_to_awe_files/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12ot1z/sophie_update_to_awe_files/">[9 comments]</a>
===My Mooshum's story===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My Mooshum (grandpa) once wrote himself a cheque from his brothers cheque book. His brother was older than he was and apparently more respectable than Mooshum was. The two of them didn&#39;t get along for obvious reasons.</p> <p>Anyways Mooshum had ripped off his brother , so he was hiding out in his home for a few days.One night at about 3am, he heard a knock. He goes to open the door, and there was his brother. He told me his brother looked sad and tired, and he didnt say anything. So Mooshum just pointed to the couch and told him he could sleep there. He had wanted to apologise for the cheque but for some reason he didnt say anything. Anyways, the next morning Mooshum hears this loud urgent knock on his door. He goes to open it and there are two police standing there. Mooshum was shittin bricks. The officers asked him if he was &quot;so and so, and last name here&quot;, and Mooshum reluctantly nodded his head yes. The officers told him his older brother passed away the previous night at 3am, he was in some kindve accident. and of course my grandpa shook his head and said no, your wrong. My brother came home in the middle of the night and he was sleeping in his couch. He even went to show the officers, but there wasnt anyone on the couch. He was shocked and I guess he started to cry. He said that he regretted stealing that money and that he wished he wouldve had said something to his brother that night. I always remember that story because My Mooshum never admits to his mistakes, and seeing his helpless regret ..i dont know, it changed my point of view of my grandpa.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/jinn979"> jinn979 </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q5h5/my_mooshums_story/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q5h5/my_mooshums_story/">[comment]</a>
===The Trick or Treater===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I thought about embellishing this story, but decided it was creepy enough as is.</p> <p>I&#39;ve almost lived in my new(to me) house for a year now, this was my first Halloween in the new neighborhood. The subdivision itself is pretty nice, I got lucky finding a foreclosure and a roommate that helps pay the mortgage. I wanted to try and make a show that I belonged in this upper class area, so I bought 50 bucks worth of full size candy bars. I can still remember how excited I was when I went trick or treating and the door opened with a bowl of full sized candy bars, I anticipated paying that forward.</p> <p>It was still light outside so my roommate and I had the garage door open while we installed a new car stereo for my truck. I put the bowl of candy in the truck bed just in case anyone with younger kids came by early. Just as we were testing out the stereo, my roommate heard a rustling over the music and jumped out of the passenger seat with a &quot;What the fuck?!&quot;</p> <p>My roommate&#39;s a fairly crude guy, and we&#39;d had a few beers, but I knew he wouldn&#39;t say that in front of any kids. I shut off the music and popped out of the driver seat to see what was up. Rummaging through the bowl of candy (which was in the back of my truck, with the tailgate up) was a man who looked to be in his mid thirties. His &quot;costume&quot; just looked like a door to door salesman, khaki colored rain coat and hat. He looked up from the candy bowl at me, pale white skin contrasted with his dark eyes, and smiled with a mouthful of crooked teeth.</p> <p>&quot;You guysss have good candy.&quot; He rasped.</p> <p>With that he grabbed a handful of candy bars, turned and limped down my driveway across the street to my neighbors house. I don&#39;t know if he had a slight handicap, or if it was just a guy who really wanted to get into his character. Me and my roommate have a running joke now which is: &quot;I wonder what would have happened to us if we had bad candy?&quot; </p> <p>Needless to say I&#39;ll be buying the same candy next year.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/LuckoftheFryish"> LuckoftheFryish </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12oy9i/the_trick_or_treater/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12oy9i/the_trick_or_treater/">[5 comments]</a>
===My mothers stories of her travels.===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So my mum went on a huge trip with her best friend once they finished highschool. Shes told me hundreds of stories of their adventures all around the world, but I&#39;ll always remember one she told me about America. Josie and my mother were doing a long drive from one state to another, picture one of those typical &#39;middle of nowhere&#39; roads, expecting to not see civilization until they saw the sun. It was a long drive. They were silently flowing through the land, having had been In the car for hours on end. The two were not talking at the time, seeing nothing to spark up a conversation. Everything was quiet, just having the car produce a comforting white noise.</p> <p>It was when my mum saw something in the distance that she became a little confused. There was a white figure a few hundred metres out, waiting by the side of the road. As she drove closer, the figure resembled more of a man. A pale white man, covered head to toe in pale white clothes, smiling at her. Now this is the part that gives me the chills. He didn&#39;t seem right. He was hailing the car, however did not look like he was in desperate need. Being stranded in the mdidle of nowhere, a destination where a car would only pass by the hour, or even longer at this time of the night. However, the man just stood there, with an unnaturally big grin.</p> <p>Mum always says that there was this vibe, that just told her not to slow down. That he was not inviting. That he would not be a nice person. So, she kept driving. Speechless. Not believing what or who she just saw. It was five or so minutes since the incident and mum finally decided to speak. &quot;Did you see th-&quot; but was automatically interrupted by Josie telling her to shut up, keep driving, and never speak of it again.</p> <ul> <li>I don&#39;t know. Maybe he could&#39;ve been just a really happy hitchiker, but I was brought up with this story at a young age so I&#39;ll always have the fear.</li> </ul> <p>EDIT - Sorry I&#39;ve already posted this, but the name did not suit reddits rules or something. :c</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/catxcakes"> catxcakes </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q2vm/my_mothers_stories_of_her_travels/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q2vm/my_mothers_stories_of_her_travels/">[comment]</a>
===Sleep deprivation + ouija board = very very bad night.===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay so this happened to me a 3 nights ago, After I had just finished a 17 hour day at work with a massive Halloween hangover to match. So when I got to my friends place for a few drinks, My head felt like it was 10 sizes to small so I felt the need to finish off the bottle of Jack Daniels I had left there the night before. </p> <p>We got to the drinking and smoking of weed that I had got prior to getting to his place. He suggested that we get his Ouija board out and see what shit we could get up to. Almost instantly we had a &quot;catch&quot;. It called itself Bud... Now I don&#39;t know if its because we were smoking bud, Or drinking Budweiser but it obviously found it funny to do so, So we went along with it. Bud started out by telling us a load of stuff about his past, how he came to be stuck in limbo and so on.</p> <p>But it wasn&#39;t until about an hour after we initiated our conversation with Bud that we started to see a very dark and evil side to him.</p> <p>If I could get pictures of what then followed I would, But... Well let&#39;s just say that things got a little too hot in the hot box.</p> <p>The curtains would move every time we tried to say goodbye and close the conversation, But Bud wasn&#39;t going to let us leave that easily.</p> <p>The bong that we had been passing, Now had blood instead of water in the base... And we only realized this after taking 3 more hits... The blood adds a certain flavor that I cannot for the life of me describe. I don&#39;t know what the hell we did to anger Bud, But we sure did so. </p> <p>After we had emptied the bong and tried to sober up with very strong coffee and stale toast, Bud thought it would be amusing to trip the breaker of the building my friends place is in and set off all the fire alarms. The rooms, corridors and stair wells filed with arid burning smoke that seemed to be on fire itself. </p> <p>We got the fuck out of there in a hurry, Along with the 200 or so residents of the building to find out that there was no smoke at all. The fire department showed up and cleared the building, Not finding a single thing to explain the smoke, There wasn&#39;t an odor of anything. Only the usual smells of a 50&#39;s era British built building (Piss and stale cigarette smoke). </p> <p>After about an hour and a half we were allowed back into the flat to find that the place was spotless. All the washing up had been done, And put away. Beer bottles/ashtrays thrown away, and our lighters has disappeared as well. Now if you&#39;re a stoner and smoke bongs, You&#39;ll know that losing your lighter is the cardinal sin. We looked all over the place for a lighter or box of matches. Now keep in mind that it was 4 in the morning with no shops or petrol stations open to get any of the above. So we were screwed.</p> <p>By now we had totally forgotten about what we were doing before all of this happened, We didn&#39;t end the conversation at all... </p> <p>Unfortunately that is all I can remember. I woke up this morning in my house (40 miles from my friends) with no knowledge at all of how I got home. My wallet and bag were still at his place so I know I didn&#39;t get home on my own, because I&#39;d need my bus and train pass to get home, And a taxi would cost way to much. </p> <p>I can still feel Bud around me, Watching, Waiting.</p> <p>I&#39;ll keep nosleep updated with what transpires in the coming hours/days. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/IWillKillYouSonnyBoy"> IWillKillYouSonnyBoy </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q2nq/sleep_deprivation_ouija_board_very_very_bad_night/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q2nq/sleep_deprivation_ouija_board_very_very_bad_night/">[3 comments]</a>
===Baby Book===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/126g7q/michaels_last_words/">Michael&#39;s Last Words</a></p> <p>As an update for all of you, I listened to the voicemail many times. I think I have every moment of it memorized at this point. In between work and this, I find it hard to even remember what I did before all of this. I don&#39;t even think I <em>did</em> do anything that special. Not unless you count channel surfing? (Or internet surfing...)</p> <p>The basic message of it seems normal, a bit too normal? I could be over thinking it. After all, maybe he just was too busy to go by the house that Sunday to help me with the shelter. That or he is acting normal because someone wants him to act that way? I&#39;m feeling paranoid. </p> <p>His message was:</p> <p>&quot;Everything seems fine here, I hope you&#39;re doing all right. Did you go to work? If so, keep up the good work. Don&#39;t slack off with your studying, either. You may be off from class now but the bar exam is coming up. I&#39;m proud of you.&quot;</p> <p>That was behind all of the static and muffling. I keep it on my phone, just so I can listen to it on my breaks and at dinner. I keep hoping that I will probably hear something that will help me know where he is. I can&#39;t even get myself to ask my Mother where he is, I&#39;m terrified of her. </p> <p>It&#39;s awful to be scared of your own Mother, but after that day in the shelter I feel like she is just waiting for me to do something. I don&#39;t know what, though.</p> <p>Either way, part of me was curious about Irene, since most of these files point to her being pregnant and the authorities stated in a few of these papers that Daniel had threatened to sue if they kept stressing her out while carrying. </p> <p>Found pages that looked familiar, and then I read a bit and noticed it was like a baby book. Those things you keep when you have a child and record day by day? She did pretty good... I got some of it down, so I&#39;ll post it now. </p> <p>Thank you all for being with me through all of this. It means so much to me. Your messages are wonderful, and I keep them all so I know you all are with me during this. </p> <p><em>Entry 1:</em></p> <p><em>You&#39;re such a beautiful little girl, Cassandra, you look just like Daddy with those pretty eyes. One day you&#39;ll read this and know how much we love you. Daddy bought me this book and now that you&#39;re with the nurses, I can write to you something that I hope you will remember.</em></p> <p><em>We will always protect you, always. No matter what. Daddy will do everything he can to protect you, and we both wish you could have met a dear friend of ours. His name was Michael, sweetie. He was a very wonderful person.

I hope you know that, sweetie.</em></p> <p><em>Love, Mommy</em></p> <p><em>Entry 5:</em></p> <p><em>You sleep wonderfully and you dont wake up so much! I guess Daddy was right. He told the nurses only to feed you when you were awake, not to wake you up to feed you. You are such a good girl, though I can&#39;t wait for your first holidays to come. Daddy says I&#39;m rushing, but I already know what I want to do for your first Halloween!</em></p> <p><em>Love, Mommy</em></p> <p><em>Entry 6:</em></p> <p><em>Being outside is a nice change. You&#39;re with Daddy, as always. He took off to watch you so I could have a day to me. But he won&#39;t let me come back early!</em></p> <p><em>I am just sitting at the park. You&#39;ll play here one day. A woman came by me and introduced herself. She gave birth a short while ago as well to a baby boy named Adam. They live right by us! She&#39;ll come over tomorrow, she says she&#39;ll bring Adam with her. Something about her neighbors being odd that makes her need time away.

===The story of me and my adventures in the wood.===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It was four AM; I&#39;m dumbstruck with shock and I still can&#39;t believe what just happened. It was eight PM when I went out to go explore the woods in the dark, I liked going there. It reminded me of medieval times and old times. I used to love the woods. Now I loathe going outside of someone&#39;s sight. No one will believe what I have seen, it is unexplainable. As I was going into the woods, I heard a rustle behind me from a neighboring bush. I jumped at first; I looked around me. The rustling was gone and there was nothing. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. As I continued down the path and into my favorite spot in the forest. The river flowing down was aquatic, it was a few feet deep; I stripped and decided to jump in the river, The river was un-naturally cold. Really cold. I jumped out at once and put my clothes back on. I don&#39;t know; but I felt something brush my leg. </p> <p>After I put on my clothes I went straight back to my mom&#39;s house. (My father and mother right now are divorced, she got the money and the house.) I heard the rustling again, and when I looked behind me. Words can not explain the creature I saw, but it was really dark with no eyes. It had some sort of scales on its arms and had a dry body. Like a normal human; but with no face. Just two black dots on a symmetrical lines and scales on the hands. The first thing I heard was a shriek, then it swiped me on my face. Blood gushed out like a stream of water. I passed out...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Bondle"> Bondle </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q22v/the_story_of_me_and_my_adventures_in_the_wood/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q22v/the_story_of_me_and_my_adventures_in_the_wood/">[comment]</a>
===Dream===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I remembered this story from when I was about 12 a couple days ago, talking to a coworker. She mentioned something about a cold room, which made me flash back to one of my memories from when mum and I were still with my step dad. </p> <p>In our basement, we had 2 bedrooms, the laundry room - with the only working shower in the house stuck in a corner - a half bathroom (you&#39;d think the shower would be there....) and the living room. For the longest time the living room was my favourite part of the house, it had beautiful built in book shelves all around the room, some with glass doors, and a large wooden bar. The only thing we needed were the stools and we could have thrown some awesome parties, but I digress. Behind the bar, there was a large cold storage room (the house being built before fridges were popular/affordable) this was the only part of the room that ever made me uneasy. Occasionally I would find that the door had opened on its own, but I always shrugged it off and just pushed it shut. Until one night. I had a dream where I was walking through the basement, everything was sort of slow and blurred. I heard a sort of muffled crying coming from the living room. I slowly walked over. As I walked into the room, I turned my head towards the cold room door, and it was wide open. Inside I saw a man, somewhere around 25 or so, standing in the cold room holding a rope. It took me a few seconds to realize the rope was tied around his neck in a noose. I walked towards him, opening my mouth to try and talk, but nothing came out. I got to the door of the cold room to see him stand on top of a short wooden four legged step stool. I tried to open my mouth again to talk as he threw the rope over a hook in the ceiling, but still nothing came out. He turned and looked at me, still crying, he said something, (I didn&#39;t remember what it was after I woke up) and then kicked the stool out from underneath him. I woke up hearing his neck break, screaming out loud in fear. </p> <p>I fretted about the dream for hours before I went into the cold room. I was drawn to it, but I kept fighting it. Finally I decided I had to see whatever was calling me. I opened the door, only to see four circular imprints in the dust on the floor. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Blueberry_Kitten"> Blueberry_Kitten </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12pi2t/dream/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12pi2t/dream/">[comment]</a>
===Son of Jacob===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I guess you could say that this is the first part. If I wrote everything our it&#39;d be too long to read. So I&#39;ll upload more later.</p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p> <p>My mother never really spoke about her father and as a child I thought nothing of it. As I got older however, I began to grow curious. Why was it I only saw Grandma? What was grandpa like? Questions of a childish nature. To my mother’s credit she never lied to me. She told me and that he was a18that he died when she was great husband to my grandmother and a great father to my mother and uncle. I felt no need to </p> <p>.pry as I was young and felt these were truthful It wasn’t until my grandmother was hospitalized for degrading health issues that come hand in hand with her age. My mother and I visited frequently and while the Alzheimer’s was slowly wearing into dementia the three of us still had </p> <p>.solid conversations One afternoon at the hospital my grandmother sent me out to grab a coffee for my mother and some water for her. I had been sitting for nearly </p> <p>.an hour, so I Wanted to stretch my legs anyway As I was walking back with the drinks, I couldn’t help but feel the need to eavesdrop. Why was this? Why would I want to eavesdrop on their conversation? Nevertheless, I slowed my pace as I entered the room, walking nearly silently. The white drawsheet blocked the view to the hallway allowing me to hear without being seen. I heard </p> <p>:my grandmother ask my mother </p> <p>”?Does he know the truth about your father, yet“ I didn’t lie to him mother, he knows some of the“ </p> <p>”.details A heavy sigh escapes my mother as I can picture the visible signs of what I can to imagine only </p> <p>.now as regret on my Mother’s face </p> <p>”.But I haven’t told him the whole truth“ I can hear my grandmother click the tip of her tongue on the back of her teeth in a </p> <p>.disapproving manner </p> <p>”.He needs to know the truth, Ann“ The way my grandmother forced my mother’s </p> <p>.name suggest to me the gravity of the situation I decided to walk into view at that point, giving my grandmother her class of water. I turned to my mother who was standing at the foot of the hospital bed. She grabbed the coffee in my </p> <p>.outstretched arm, but her eyes avoided mine 3My grandmother passed away peacefully </p> <p>.months later The funeral was low key, but it felt right giving my grandmother her last respects. My uncle had flown in which was nice because I had not seen him for quite some time. Both my mother and my uncle attended the will hearing, but I did not as I had work later that night. So I dove myself </p> <p>.home and took a nap on the couch This I can remember so vividly. I woke up to a clicking sound, coming from my room. The -closer I got to my door, the louder it grew ‘click click-click’ until it was almost unbearable. The sound was shaking my skull and felt like I was about to throw up if it didn’t stop soon. I had no choice but to go into my room. I grabbed the door handle and peeled my hand back. It was ice cold. I reached back to it and opened the door slowly. All I could see in my room were tens if not a hundred of hangmen’s nooses dangling from my ceiling. In the middle of the ,room was my grandmother hanging by her neck .mouth and eyes wide up staring straight ahead As I started to walk backwards out of the room the clicking suddenly stopped, and the entire house was silent. I took a second look at the corpse of my grandmother and her eyes ,snapped to me and she smiled a disgusting maniacal smile. As I started to turn to escape a voice to deep and demonic to be human </p> <p>:whispered into my ear </p> <p>”.You can’t run, son of Jacob“ I awoke in a cold sweat and screaming. I was on .the brink of tears and I felt dizzy and nauseous .It took me a few moments to gather myself What the fuck was that dream about? I never have nightmares. Who is Jacob? I never knew my </p> <p>.father, but his name was Jeremy, not Jacob PM my mother and uncle arrived6At around home. She was carrying a wooden box that was about the size of a nightstand. She placed it by .the door and told me to come take a look at it The box had a little clasp on the front that she released to open the box. Inside were various links of silver, gold, and platinum. With gorgeous sets of jewels cut into various pieces attached </p> <p>.here in there in a mess of beauty It’s your grandmother’s jewelry box’” my mother“ said. “Your grandfather build it for her on their </p> <p>”.th anniversary 10 She rested her hand upon my shoulder and reached into the box. She pulled out a long slender chain from within it. Attached to the chain was a silver circle about the size of the palm of my hand. She placed the chain into my hand and I brought the circle closer to my face to inspect it. There was a small knob where the chain is attached. I press it and the face of the </p> <p>.circle popped open to reveal a clock face It was your grandfather’s pocket watch, he kept“ it on him all the time. Your grandmother wanted </p> <p>.you to have it.” My uncle told me He picked up from my hands and wound the knob at the top. From the frown on his face this </p> <p>.had no remarkable effect on the clock face ”.This old thing is broken though, a shame really“ </p> <p>.He said when he handed it back to me I told my mother that I wasn’t feeing too great when she asked me if I wanted to go out for dinner, but I told them to go ahead without me </p> <p>.and that I’d call into work sick PM when they left and my uncle7It was around </p> <p>:7:30texted me at In the jewelry box, under the container’s wooden .

He addressed me by name, which put me on edge for some reason. Usually he calls me ‘Bud’ or Buddy’ just in a joking way that my uncle‘ constantly is. What the fuck was going on </p> <p>?tonight I looked at the box by the door just as my mother had left it. I felt a shiver engulf my entire body. I walked to the jewelry box and undid the clasp. I lifted the lid and moved all the jewelry off to one side. I tapped the middle and the sound was hollow knock. There was something under it. I lifted the base up by the engraved sides and beneath it was a large combination lock. I spun the lock for each number.

===Sickness===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When it comes to getting sick I am a huge mess, escpecially when it comes to getting the flu. but I wasn&#39;t always like that. It all started a year ago this spring.</p> <p>I was visiting my friend cabin in really the middle of nowhere, even though it was spring break, there was snow up to my waist, and the lake was frozen solid. Everything started out really fun, we went ice fishing, sledding, had snow ball fights. All the fun stuff.</p> <p>Then the first night I got really sick, I was throwing up every five minutes and i couldn&#39;t do anything but writhe in pain. In the morning I was fine so we had fun and played all day again. The second night was the same, pain and puke everywhere.</p> <p>But the last night was SO much worse. I was sick exactly like the two other night but there was a bit of a difference. Instead of throwing up, I was spaziming and shaking. But thats not it. I could feel somethign staring at me from the corner of the room. It wasn&#39;t like a normal stare of sympathy. It was dark and cruel. It was like if this thong stared at you for too long it would crush you. My Dad, who was laying there comforting me didn&#39;t seem to notice it at all.</p> <p>The next day we left because me dad had work, and I couldn&#39;t take being there anymore, not after the staring. when we got home I burst into tears and told my mom what happened while my dad and sister unpacked their things. I told her everything but the staring. It was a detail no one needed to know.</p> <p>A week later we went to my doctor, who said I needed some tests done. We learnt that I had anxiety. I was put on medication and was fine for a little while. </p> <p>Then last night I not only had an axienty attack but the flu. I relived the nights in the cabin all over again. But the staring was back. This time though it came with a body. It was terrifying. Imagine Slenderman with out tentacles and black deep souless eyes and a wide grinning mouth with razor sharp teeth, and you&#39;ll get what I saw.</p> <p>It called to me. But it didn&#39;t move. It said I wasn&#39;t supposed to see him, but I was a &#39;special little girl&#39; so he made an exception. He said that he could have given me something much worse than the flu, but it was the thing I was most afraid of so thats what he gave me. Lastly he said his &#39;name&#39; was sickness. Then he started dissapearing like the cheshire cat from Alice in Wonderland, until only the eyes were left. They dissapeared as my Dad and Mom walked into my room. they said I had been crying loudly and they came to check on me, wondering if my night terrors were back.</p> <p>I told them about the staring, but not about the thing that came with it. The next morning I could hear them talking about setting me up with a counseller, I don&#39;t blame them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/vladtodlover"> vladtodlover </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12pl7o/sickness/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12pl7o/sickness/">[3 comments]</a>
===Challenge? (part two)===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12lmto/challenge_part_one/">Last post.</a> Last post I talked about how the shadow has started to wear clothes that resemble mine, but seem to be color swapped. For example I have a signature hoodie I wear all the time witch I green with black lettering while the shadows has started to wear the same hoodie in black with green letters. Well that wasn’t all that the shadow has copied of me.<br/> When all of this was happening I was also lining my normal life and because it was close to Halloween I had started making my costume. My family likes to go all out for Halloween by making all our own costumes. Mine this year involved me carving a wooden mask that was intended to have an African tribal feel. Well when was about almost done and only had painting left it looked like <a href="https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=f89c61a033&amp;view=att&amp;th=13ad2efb93c7bd62&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=inline&amp;realattid=1417841095375585280-1&amp;safe=1&amp;zw&amp;saduie=AG9B_P_n2pHEOnd8p9UXyJT2_eX9&amp;sadet=1352173112695&amp;sads=ABK7_7AA7_RWb0gr9F-WYMoUkBI">this</a> And my plan and eventual execution would be that it would look like <a href="https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=f89c61a033&amp;view=att&amp;th=13acdbc2fb3802b3&amp;attid=0.7&amp;disp=inline&amp;realattid=1417749522626379776-7&amp;safe=1&amp;zw&amp;saduie=AG9B_P_n2pHEOnd8p9UXyJT2_eX9&amp;sadet=1352173217971&amp;sads=TKz_0Tl3v14_j_pt1prwrp4stqo">this</a> I had only told a couple of my friends what I planned to do with the mask The night I was ready to paint I was asleep when the knocking came for the last time. I snapped awake and grabbed my knife from under my pillow. Normally the thing will go away when I have the knife in my hand, nut this time the knocking got worse. This made me nervous so I got out of bed, with knife in hand; this time he was plastered to the window above my bed and wearing my mask! It was different though. It was painted; painted in the reverse colors of my PLANNED mask. It was red wear mine was supposed to be white and vice versa. I was so focused on his mask that did not notice that he was nocking faster and louder. I continued to not notice until my dog got up from his coma and began to growl and bark at the thing in the window. The thing pounded harder on the window getting louder and Louder and LOOUDER. He was hitting the window so hard, so loudly and for so long that the glasses vibrated with the noise and looked like it was going to shatter. The entire time we just stared at each other, him wanting to get at me and I ready .but hopping with all my will that the glass would hold. Then just as the glass finally seemed about to inevitably crack I noticed a light coming from my night stand and shelves. I looked and realized that it was both my stone bear and little bird charm. They continued to glow getting exceedingly bright until I couldn’t see anything in the room. Panicking because I couldn’t see anything I swung wildly .then finally when the light calmed the thing was gone. I stood there in my room with my dog as if nothing had happened. Since that night I wore my necklace religiously and kept the knife in my pocket at all times I could. Unfortunately about a week later I was out with my friends on a Saturday. I feel safe with my friends because for some reason I have never seen the shadow around other people. My friends and I went all over our town that night driving from one hang out place to another until around eleven at one of my female friends , Bailey, looks at me for a second then turns back and says “Hey, Jay. Your necklace; the little charm is gone. Did it fall off?” I felt sick and instantly afraid. I quickly snapped my hand to my neck and found the string the thing was on, nut the bird wasn’t there. The clasp was broken. I panicked. I searched everywhere around us and all the places we had been to in the last hour until I gave up hope. That night it did not come, but I still did not sleep easy. After this I knew that what as things were going now this was very likely to not end well, so I decided I needed to tell someone what was going on. I was nervous though so I started waiting for a good time. I did not have to wait very long because about two days later my friend ,Damien, proposed that we have a “fright night” (which is wear we find some haunted or scary place and just tell scary stories late into the night) because it was only a few weeks to Halloween; this was uncannily perfect. We had a the “fright night” two days later in a tunnel, near my friend, Jordan’s house, that was supposedly haunted by a worker who died building the tunnel. My friend Gabe has a lot of ghost detection stuff because he is currently be haunted by his dead aunt, but that&#39;s a story he should tell. Any way he brought all his stuff and for some reason I had to carry it in my back pack, which also contained my knife, finished mask and stone bear. In his kit was an E.M.F. detector which is supposed to detect ghosts and the supernatural by sensing the electric field they have. I was in charge of while we told stories. I was quite most of the time just holding the E.M.F. in my hand, messing with my knife and thinking about what I was going to tell my friends. Then while I was sitting there listening, I accidentally waved my knife near the E.M.F. and the thing went crazy! The lights all went off and it started beeping, loudly. My friends all jumped to their feet thinking that we were being visited by a ghost and I had to calm them down. This for me confirmed what I had been told about the knife by Eric’s uncle. I then tried this with the bear and was horrified to find that the E.M.F. didn’t even beep. I then sat there with a renewed fear because whatever the bear did according to this devise it would not do it again. When all my friends were done with their stories I started to tell all that I have told you so far. My friends told me later that as I began to talk wind filled the tunnel. Then as the last world of my story left my mouth a loud banging noise came from outside; it sounded like a piece of metal being smacked by a two by four. Everyone in the tunnel jumped to their feet. We all stared down the tunnel were the noise came from. We stood there for a second and then I shoved everything but my knife in my back pack. I stood back up and joined my friends staring down the tunnel and almost as if on cue the reverse mask began to peak around the corner… My friends flipped out, started screaming jumping around and holding on to each other. I almost did that; believe me I really wanted to ,but I swallowed my fear and sprinted down the tunnel ,towards it, with knife in hand and giving the loudest war cry I could have made. From what I remember through the fear and adrenalin fueled haze I was running towards the thing in the mask when it started laughing , a horrible unearthly laugh, made of many voices, then its mask seamed to focused in on the knife in my hand, turned back to me, pivoted and sprinted out the tunnel. I chased it to the opening and for about fifty yards, but it was so fast, inhumanly fast. I was sick of this though, I yelled after it… “Come back, pansy! You want me? Come get me! I am sick of this! Whoever you are, are you challenging me?! Well I except! Come get me coward, you started this, but I will finish it!” Since then nothing big has happened, but I don’t think he is gone. He was never afraid of me he was always afraid of the knife. I have started to carry it with me at all times, except at school and even then I have been hiding it just outside of school grounds, near my path to school. I also haven’t been sleeping well, I have been up really late each night witch is making staying wake during the day hard so my grades are slipping because I can’t stay awake in school. Even if this thing is gone I think it might have messed me up pretty bad. My friends have also pretended nothing happened. I hope this is all over, but if it isn&#39;t I will make sure to tell you guys.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Wishingforwendio"> Wishingforwendio </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12pk6v/challenge_part_two/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12pk6v/challenge_part_two/">[5 comments]</a>
===Hunted===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I live in northern Canada where the winters are long and cold. My dad and I have gone hunting every year since I was a little kid. But this last year my father passed away from cancer which made this season particularly difficult. It was the first year I’ve ever gone hunting without him but I decided to go anyways and hunt with his rifle. I loaded up my quad and prepared for a full weekend of hunting. My friend Jed was going to come along for the hunt. He wasn’t as experienced as I in hunting these woods but the support was much needed. We left for the weekend in early November to hunt moose as we were drawn for it that year. It was a strange feeling being up there without my dad and really hard to hunt the same areas we used to hunt together. Jed and I decided that it would be best to look for a new area to hunt for this year. The day grew later and we didn’t find sign of any animals. It was nearing time to head back for the truck when it started to snow. Light was fading quickly so we turned around and started the ride back to the trucks. We figured it must have been at least 5-7 miles back but wanted to get in all the hunting we could before it became dark. On the ride back we saw a small group of moose, a calf, two cows, and a bull. They obviously had heard us long before we noticed them as they took off running up hill from us. We veered off the trail in pursuit of them in hope to get a good shot lined up. We didn’t go 100 feet when Jed rode over a stump and somehow broke an axle. We didn’t have any of the tools with us to even jury rig a repair to limp it back to the truck so we decided I would ride alone and bring back the tools. It was about a 40 minute round trip ride to the truck and back but when I got back to where I left Jed he was gone. </p> <p>Jed knew better than to wander off and get lost so I figured he may have seen an animal and pursued it. I found no tracks to give evidence to his direction and was completely baffled. I couldn’t leave him and fixing his quad was a two man job so I waited. It was long since dark and I sat thinking about my dad and everything he taught me about hunting when I was little. Suddenly I heard the crack of a gunshot followed quickly by two more. “If you ever get lost son, fire your gun three times into the air and I’ll come find you.” I remember the lesson as if my dad were standing right next to me reminding me. </p> <p>I quickly hopped on my quad and rode toward the direction of the shots. It was completely dark by now and the snow was falling harder than ever making the trip slow going. The shots sounded as though they came from uphill of me so I continued that direction. After riding for a few minutes I stopped to listen again but heard nothing. When I tried to continue up the hill on my quad it was beginning to slip considerably and I decided to stop and continue on foot for fear to rolling it. Luckily tonight was a full moon and it was easy to see where I was going. After I crested the hill and looked around I saw no evidence of Jed or where the gunshots came from. I waited for a few minutes and just listened. In the treeline to the right of me I heard a series of grunts and suddenly the moose we had pursued burst out into the open charging me. I was caught completely off guard and knocked to the ground. I fired a few rounds off and seemed to scare them away for the time being. Of all the years I have been out hunting I have never experienced such an event. I decided I would be more careful and if Jed was out there I would let him come to me. I lit one of the road flares I carried in my backpack for starting fires and held it for a while hoping the light would both signal my location and also ward off the moose if they decided to try for me again. Again I waited; I waited for the duration of my flare but saw and heard nothing more. I began to worry as there was no way that Jed didn’t hear my gunshots from the top of the hill. I decided to head back for the quad hoping that Jed would find his way back to his and wait for me. As I retraced my steps down the hill I wasn’t sure what to think, the thought of losing a good friend this year as well was nearly unbearable. I got back to my quad after the short hike to find Jed’s buck knife stuck in the right front tire; all four were slashed lengthwise and the gas line had been cut. I was completely stranded miles from the truck and hours from dawn. I was stricken with fear, Jed wouldn’t do that to my quad but that was his knife nonetheless. Scenarios played out in my mind about what happened to him and then a terrible realization came over me. Whoever did this would have been able to see me on top the the hill when I lit the flare. </p> <p>I decided that I would try to make it back to the truck on foot. If I was careful and didn’t use any lights I figured I would be able to get there undetected. It would likely take me all night though and the snow showed no signs of letting up. </p> <p>I began to hike. It was slow going as I was afraid of tripping and falling down the hill. I had been walking for about twenty of thirty minutes when I felt a sharp stab in the back of my right leg. I looked down to see an arrow protruding from one side to the other. I fell to the ground in agony and before I could react a man was on top of me ripping my rifle from my hands. I felt powerless and he towered over me. </p> <p>“These are my woods, you should have never come here.” He spat with a sharp kick to my kidney. I didn’t know what to do he had my rifle and at least 60 pounds on me.</p> <p>“What did you do with my friend?” I shouted angrily hoping to not show signs of fear.</p> <p>“The same thing I’m going to do to you.” With this he raised my father&#39;s rifle and pulled the trigger. I heard the tick of the firing pin striking the bullet but it didn’t go off. In the years I had hunted with my dad his rifle never once had a misfire. Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I saw the bull moose come charging straight for the man. It was upon him and trampling him before he knew what happened. If you’ve never seen a moose let me tell you they are massive and in a few quick stomps I heard the chest of the man collapse with a resounding crack; there was no way he survived. With this the moose walked away to never be seen by me again. I found my way back to the truck by sunrise where I had service enough to call for help on my phone. After waiting for an hour or so medical services arrived accompanied by the sheriff. It was three days before search and rescue found Jed’s body. He had been shot three times in the chest with his own rifle. </p> <p>When the sheriff found the body of the trampled man they said they couldn’t find any moose tracks but sure enough he had been crushed. </p> <p>I never found out what happened that night; all I know is that I was never hunting alone. My father was with me the whole time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Akuda"> Akuda </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12ps0g/hunted/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12ps0g/hunted/">[1 comment]</a>
===I feel you guys would like to hear what happened last night.===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Alright, so my name is David. Lately, I&#39;ve been going out for hookah with my friends. I&#39;ll use real names because that&#39;s the least of my problems. Katarina, or Kat, for short, is the girl I&#39;ve been crushing on for a while. She kind of dictates these hookah meetings. Tonight I, of course, joined her, and she brought our friend Andrei. It was fun and nothing unusual happened there, but before we went in, my friend Hunter calls me, and he&#39;s been home alone for weeks now because his parents kind of up and moved to Korea. I know right? He has this whole huge house to himself, too. Anyways, he calls to ask if we want to come over, because he thinks he&#39;s losing his mind and lately been spooking himself over the idea that his house is haunted. We&#39;ve gone over there after hookah before, so we were fine with the idea. An out of place thing he said was that he &quot;conversed with himself in the mirror.&quot; I&#39;d give you the whole backstory to everyone here, but it&#39;s nothing related to what happened tonight. </p> <p>This has been the first time in a long time Andrei and Hunter have met. They vaguely knew each other back in high school, shared a class or something. Anyways, we get bored of just standing around and talking, so we give Andrei the tour of this damn nice house, showing him how nice the rooms are and everything. We end up going down to the basement to play some Rocksmith and chill. Kat has, by now, been talking about how tired she&#39;s getting. She sticks around for one more song and goes upstairs to sleep on a bed. Nothing crosses our minds, she works in a few hours, and she needs her sleep, etc. </p> <p>Got enough backstory here? Alright here&#39;s where it got fucking creepy. It&#39;s my turn with the guitar, and Kat comes back downstairs, holding her arms like she&#39;s scared. All she really has for us is a frightened whining and something along the lines of:</p> <p>&quot;This house is so haunted! Oh my god! That was the scariest thing I&#39;ve ever seen!&quot;</p> <p>Now Hunter and I had been talking about how we thought it was haunted for a while, and we had some strange sounds and small happenings, but what what caught us was the fact that she saw it. We had never even thought this was a ghost that would take to being sighted or anything of the sort. Curious, we asked exactly what she saw, trying to keep the mood light.</p> <p>&quot;Well I heard some scratching and then a crash, and thought you guys were fucking with me, so I got up and when I came near the bathroom, I saw it.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Saw what? What did it look like?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Well it was skinny and had REALLY long fingernails, like claws almost. It was also on all fours and I ran as soon as I saw it, but I think it ran down the hallway. Oh my god I am so scared!&quot;</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to fit all I can into one explanation, as we had to pry to get a lot of that. Hunter and Andrei decided to take a look around upstairs, thinking it could very well be a burglar or something of the sort. Sure enough, they find nothing. Andrei assumes it only fucks with people who are alone, and offers to lay down up there for a little bit and see if he can verify anything. We give him like 20 minutes, and then I go up and check on him. He&#39;s taken to sitting on the stairwell at this point, so I assume something happened. He seems very quiet and gives me a look like I should do the same. I come up and quietly ask if he saw anything, and he leads me in, saying that he didn&#39;t actually see it, but he knows he heard the scratching, like a pitter-patter or something, and then a deep sort of growl, so he left. When we went back in, objects had been moved and it did seem like something else was in there. We&#39;d figured out it liked the walk-in closet in the back of the bathroom, since that&#39;s where both occurances were at this point. He said he&#39;d only try one more time and then he was done. I stayed on the main level of the house, to hear if anything happened. It did.</p> <p>I heard the bedroom door slam, and he yelled out in surprise, so I dashed up and swung the door open, and the lights switched on as soon as I did that. Andrei is now scared out of his mind, now crawled into the corner of the room and kind of laughing at how crazy that was. After I let him collect himself, and I shut the bathroom doors, he told me the door slammed, the lights flicked off, and he saw the outline of eyes skitter out of the closet and start to close in on him. </p> <p>&quot;pupil-less, white eyes. Its roar or growl or whatever was like nothing I&#39;d ever heard. As soon as you came in, it disappeared.&quot;</p> <p>At this point I&#39;m ready to shit a brick. When I go downstairs, Hunter is occupying himself on the laptop, and Kat is giggling and talking about how sad he looked, and how he just wanted to dance. Hunter motions that she&#39;s lost it, snapped and doesn&#39;t seem sane at all. She gets up and tries to do little ballerina dances with me. She doesn&#39;t dance, so I&#39;m a little wierded out. She begins to talk about how it wanted to dance, to fix its blood, which is black, but pools on the ground as gold. She obviously was not well, and was not acting at all like her normal self, and the laughing, oh god the laughing, she had such an out of character laugh which shook me at my core. We were going to leave.</p> <p>I took her keys out of her purse, they got her into the car, and we all just... left. We had no idea where to go at 4 in the morning, so we just drove and drove. She kept boring on about how he didn&#39;t like that we were leaving, and that he couldn&#39;t leave. She sang a lullaby, which was about blood from black to gold, and how he needed to dance. Needless to say we were all flipping the fuck out mentally. I&#39;m trying to keep conversation with her, whether it&#39;s about what&#39;s freaking us out, or trying to bring her back to normal talk. Hunter starts making connections and quoting poetry, she starts to synchronize and commend him, she has never read any of this before, because half of it is stuff he wrote himself. All of our mental states were worn thin by then.</p> <p>We must have driven for an hour or so, and I had decided to start heading back. She fell asleep, and before too long, she woke up. She was back to being the real Katarina. She also didn&#39;t remember anything since hookah, even though she was the one that drove to Hunter&#39;s, and she watched us play guitar and all that. I decided we all needed some real sleep, and started to drop us off. Andrei had been quiet and stressed for a while now, and so we decided to drop him off. This is where the story winds down, this isn&#39;t necessary information. I switch places with the now fully sane Kat, and the three of us head to my house, but they decide not to hang out, and Hunter and I are trying our hardest to not tell her of what actually happened last night. My excuse to explain what really happened was that she fell asleep, we got a little spooked and decided we needed to leave, and so we loaded her up in the car with us, and I was driving because she was still asleep. Hunter has since decided to go back home, muttering about his fault and something about &quot;inner demons.&quot;</p> <p>So here I am now back at home, safe. What disturbs me is that this may not be over, and Hunter described the creature as something very similar to &quot;the rake.&quot; When, if ever, should I tell Kat? Was she possessed? Acting out of sheer shock? If you creepy-knowledgeable folks can fill me in here, or something, that would do a lot to my state of mind.</p> <p>Hunter also claimed to have caught a little of when we were in the car on camera, I&#39;ll ask him tomorrow if he can upload it to youtube or something. I know the rules say something about not needing proof and whatnot, but still. This is easily the most horrifying experience in my life, and I wasn&#39;t about to risk forgetting it or something. I wish I could write it off as someone spiking our hookah or something, but I was in full control of my mind, and very afraid.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Dudedood"> Dudedood </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q5xb/i_feel_you_guys_would_like_to_hear_what_happened/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q5xb/i_feel_you_guys_would_like_to_hear_what_happened/">[comment]</a>
===Not sure if its my imagination.===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just so everyone is clear on this it&#39;s all 100% true.</p> <p>Ok so I&#39;m always hearing foot steps in my house that aren&#39;t my parents or little brother. I&#39;ve always caught glimpses of things that aren&#39;t there, but within the last couple weeks thing have gotten weird. Now it could be my over active imagination but if not I&#39;d like some advice about what could be going on. </p> <p>Background: I&#39;m 21 making me the oldest, I live with my parents while I&#39;m in school. I also have a little brother whose 17. My family is pretty into the whole spirits/demons/ghosts stuff but we&#39;ve never been the type to play with a calling them out. </p> <p>A few months ago my brother (who never really let&#39;s anything get to him) was sleeping and he always sleeps in pj bottoms and no shirt. He sleeps on a loft bed which is like a bunk bed with no lower bunk and his head is always facing the window which is almost the opposite of his door. Anyways well he when he woke up the next morning he was laying with his head facing the door, his pants off and folded hanging off his ladder. He wasn&#39;t worried but I was like whaaaaat?</p> <p>Anyways last couple weeks little things have been happening. The foot steps are normal since its usually 2-3 steps and you can&#39;t get anywhere in my house unless you&#39;re just standing there. The new things are that I hear the clinking of dishes in the middle of the night, things fall over in my room and its not my cats since they&#39;re in my bed. Sometimes I&#39;ll be sitting around and my cats will just stop and stare at the same spot on the wall for 5 min. and lately one of the cats has been staring at certain spots on the floor and won&#39;t look at me not matter what sounds I make and then he&#39;ll run off chasing the invisible thing. Another thing was that the same cat was in the bathroom with me and stops mid lick and states up at the top of the shower and hisses.</p> <p>The other night I fell asleep earlier than usual but woke up like I hadn&#39;t been sleeping at all around 4 am and I had a feeling I was being watched and refused to open my eyes. I was suddenly freezing and then hot. God it got so hot I started sweating so I turned my fan towards me and took off a blanket and felt better but took me an hour to fall back asleep.</p> <p>The last thing was that I was looking for my phone the other morning and I could&#39;ve sworn it was in my bed but I was throwing the pillows and blankets everywhere and couldn&#39;t find it. I was about to call it quits and was putting my stuff back on the bed and there was m phone. Sitting in the middle of the damn pillow that I just just flipped over.</p> <p>Ok so I&#39;m known to have an over active imagination but these things (the stuff before) has been going on for as long as I remember. My aunts house is worse, but the house itself is an old farmhouse that&#39;s over 100 years old and both her parents died in the house and she also has a stronger affinity for things paranormal, but that&#39;s a different story.</p> <p>So my question is: is it just my imagination and if not what is it and why is it becoming more active? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/CatPatronus"> CatPatronus </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12p1lr/not_sure_if_its_my_imagination/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12p1lr/not_sure_if_its_my_imagination/">[2 comments]</a>
===A crying king (update)===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If this is the first you hear about this you should start from the beginning:</p> <p>PART 1: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12kmuc/i_think_i_am_becoming_human/">http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12kmuc/i_think_i_am_becoming_human/</a></p> <p>PART 2: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12na6o/the_smell_of_phosgene_update/">http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12na6o/the_smell_of_phosgene_update/</a></p> <p>As i am falling i feel no fear, i feel the cold autumn breeze, i see Madrid under a grey sky. At first i can see all the way to the Royal palace, the sun struggles to scape the thick embrace of the clouds without success. After a second i start to feel gravity pulling me to my destination 8 floors down to the ground, i did it, i am safe now. Once i hit the ground am gone. What should i do now? What does my father want me do do? I have no more instructions. Maybe visiting the morge would the best option, i could take a look to that body. Or should i go to my father&#39;s house? Both locations are probably compromised, either way i have to watch out for more trouble. Who were those guys? How did they knew i was there? Who tricked them into going to the next door apartment? I still don&#39;t know where my father is. I decided to go directly to the morge, maybe i have time to get there safely after my dad just killed a bunch of them. I hit the ground in an inner yard of the building behind mine, broke a table and some clotheslines on the way down, made a lot of noise, i am sure someone saw me. I started running inmediatly. Got to the front door of the building, it was clear. I kept running till i got to santo Domingo plaza near Callao and got in a taxi. I told the driver to take me to the Instituto Anatomico Forense at Ciudad Universitaria. By the way he looked at me i knew something was wrong, i took a look at myself and i was dirty and my shirt was a mess, zipped up my coat and tried to look better for my visit to the institute.</p> <p>I got there in like 20minutes, everything seemed normal from the outside so i went in. Talked to the receptionist and explained why i was there, she told me to go to the second floor and ask for doctor Garcia. I found him inside a small office near to the morge. He invites le to come inside while he sais is sorry for my loss, i try to act sad for him. He says he is sorry for not taking me to see the body right away because the police has some questions for me.</p> <p>-Dr: Garcia: sorry we will have to wait 5 minutes till a police officer gets here, please sit down. -me: thank you i rather stand. And congratulations.- he seems a little surprised by my last words, but was trying to hide it. - i am talking about your recent promotion.- i added. -Dr. Garcia: thanks, i know.- he replied. -me: actually i was talking about the birthday card you got from your wife yesterday, its right here on your desk- He then went for his coat like to pull out a gun but before he could do anything i had him pinned down to the wall -who are you? Why are you trying to cach me? What do you know about me?- -Garcia: we know everything about you FREAK, you are a fucking abomination, spited out from the pit of hell, you and your kind have had it easy for to long. Now thanks to what your father has done we are going to kill you all, jajajajaja- -me: you seem really happy for a man with a gun pointed ad his head. Where is my father and what do you say he did?- -Garcia: jajajaja, your father has doomed you all, he has figered out how to kill your kind. Once we get our hands on his notes i will all be over for you- -me: where is he? How did you knew where to find me? Who are you?- i ask while i hit him on the head. -Garcia: doesn&#39;t matter if you have the gun, we are all over this building, we know you are here, when we finish stealing your father&#39;s body they would be comming here to take you with him. You are the only one who has an idea of where your father&#39;s research could be hidden. He told us where to find you before we killed him, of course now we know he sent us to the next door apartment on purpouse to make your scape possible, that cunt! He is a problem even after dead- - me: fuck you, you fucking liar! My father is not dead, where do you have him? Who is the dead guy?- -Garcia: we have him alright, but he is as dead as you will be after we are done with you, jajajaja- -me: shut up you fucki...- The door opens with a loud Bam! And two guys with guns come in, i shot them on the head and pushed the faje doctor towards the door.-you are comming with me- Before i went outside the office i stole my alleged father&#39;s necropsy file. And went to the hall way with the doctor by my side, i was pointing the gun at him on his back so nobody else would see it. We headed to the morge to take a look at this body but when i was close to the door fice guys where comming out with guns where comming out with a body bag, when they saw me started shooting, they hit me a couple of times and hit the doctor on his leg, he started bleeding and crying for help. -me: some nice friends you got there. What, are they trying to kill you? -Garcia: they would never leave you take me alive- </p> <p>I started shooting at them but the police came from the other side and also started shooting at them. Someone must have called them when i killed the other to guys. I was free to head to the frontdoor. When i got to the street i heard a loud gunshot comming from one of the rooftops acroos the street and the fake doctor fell to the ground with his brains all over the sidewalk. Inmediatly i ran. As i was crossing the street i noticed a billboard on the corner, it got my attention because it had a drawing on it, my god! The drawing was of a tattoo i had designed and placed on my left shoulder. It was a of a crying king. I had it made when my mother died and i understood i wasn&#39;t going to see her again in the rest of my long life. It also had text on it. It read: you will find your path in your darkest hour. It was definitely a message from my father, void of meaning to anyone else but me, he really did think about every detail. I knew where i should go now, my father was telling me he would meet me at my mothers grave. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/eternal_wait"> eternal_wait </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q5ny/a_crying_king_update/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q5ny/a_crying_king_update/">[comment]</a>
===There was a man standing in my garden.===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey nosleep ! I&#39;m going to tell you what happened to me 7 years ago, sorry if my english isn&#39;t perfectly perfect. I have never told this any of my friends (they wouldn&#39;t believe me), so it&#39;s the first time i&#39;m telling this story.</p> <p>I&#39;m 20, and i live with my parents, in the same house as always. I live in a very small village in the north of France (i mean VERY small). And 7 years ago, there were only 2 houses in my &quot;street&quot; (i&#39;m not even sure this was a street, let&#39;s just call it a path between fields.), mine and my neighbour&#39;s one. There were basically NO house except ours, at a perimeter of 300m (1000yards i guess).</p> <p>So, i lived with my parents and my little sister, while my neighbour&#39;s house was inhabited by a man and his son, Lucas, who was my age (and still is i guess...). He was my friend. On friday evening, from 6 to 10pm, Lucas&#39; father was playing volleyball, so he left his house for a few hours, and Lucas came at my home until his dad came back, every friday evening. We were playing N64 and the motherfucking Goldeneye. Great memories. We were playing it in the living room.</p> <p>There is a big window in my living room, showing our garden. 7 years ago, we had just put a hedge between my garden and my neighbour&#39;s one. The hedge was still very small, so we could easily see my neighbour&#39;s garden. It was big, and had one of those lights which turn on whenever somebody walks in front of it.</p> <p>So it was one friday night, like 8pm, and as usual, Lucas was with me at my house because his father was out. It was the winter, probably December or January, so it was dark outside very early. We were playing N64 in the living room (lights on), when a light turns on outside. We stopped playing and looked through the window, it was the light in my neighbour&#39;s garden, turning on as if somebody had walked in front of it. But the light of the room was on, so we couldnt see well through the window, because of the reflections. I get up to turn off the room&#39;s light, and when i do, we see the shadow of a man just standing in front of my neighbour&#39;s garden, 5 meters (15yd) away from the lamp. The guy was not moving, he seemed like frozen. We freaked out. This couldn&#39;t be Lucas&#39; father as his car wasn&#39;t here, and he was at volleyball. It couldn&#39;t be anyone &quot;known&quot;, because there were only 2 fucking house in the path !!! My reflex was to turn the light back on, and both shouted for my father to come. We were completely panicked. When my father came, we explained him, and he turned the light of the room off. There was nobody outside. My neighbour&#39;s lamp was off, and there was not a single trace of anybody who would have been here. We call lucas father, as predicted he is still at volleyball. I feel that my dad doesn&#39;t really believe us when we tell him WE SAW SOMEONE. We manage to make him go outside and check my neighbour&#39;s garden, and we see nothing.</p> <p>My father told us that we must have imagined someone, but we didn&#39;t. We both saw the light turning on and we both saw somebody standing, just waiting. We were 13 years old, so we were too old to have imagined all that. Our eyes didn&#39;t lie, there was someone. Who was this ? what was he doing here ? why didn&#39;t he move when he saw us ? (well i guess he saw us, as we were checking outside the window when i hadn&#39;t turned off the room&#39;s light yet)</p> <p>This is probably not the best story you&#39;ve ever read, but 7 years later this still freaks me out, and this is the only thing that ever happened in my life for which i have absolutely no clue of what happened. I still live in the same house, the hedge between my garden and my neighbour&#39;s one (not the same neighbours) is now huge, but whenever i look through that window, i remember that guy standing in front of the light. The worst part of this is that i have no end to give you guys. I wish i had, but i don&#39;t know the end of the story, i don&#39;t know who was there.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Clemobide"> Clemobide </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12ofjs/there_was_a_man_standing_in_my_garden/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12ofjs/there_was_a_man_standing_in_my_garden/">[6 comments]</a>
===The family===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This incident happened a few years back when I was around 14-15 years old. I&#39;ve thought much about it since and it always gives me shivers. To this day, I have no idea what it was that I encountered. If anyone has had something similar happen to them, please share that with me in the comments.</p> <p>Many weird things have happened to me in my neighborhood. It has many old houses and many seem to be haunted…or worse.</p> <p>Anyways, here&#39;s the story of that night;</p> <p>I was walking home from a friend’s house. Me and a few friends had been watching a movie and having a good time. But it was a school night and my mom asked me to be home by 10:30 that night. I wasn‘t too happy about having to go home sooner than my friends but I wasn&#39;t about to argue with my mom, she made the rules and I had to obey. It was about 10 pm when I said goodbye to my friends, and headed home.</p> <p>Because it was winter time, it was dark outside and quite cold. I decided to walk fast so I wouldn&#39;t have to stay outside in the cold for too long. My friend only lived a few streets away and I had walked this route many times before. Because I knew the way, my mind drifted off and my head was somewhere else.</p> <p>Suddenly I realized it was even darker outside then it had been a few minutes before. I felt as if I was being watched and looked around in a hurry. My neighborhood looked the same, but something was off. I didn&#39;t know what, but just something didn&#39;t seem quite the same. There were no sounds around me anymore, no cars, no people walking and no animals around, nothing. It was as if everything was scared, waiting for something to pass so everything could go back to normal. At that point I felt anxious to get home, get away from the silence. I sped up a little and my footsteps were the only sign of life in the street.</p> <p>Then I felt it. I stopped immediately. Something powerful was calling out to me, wanting me to look its way. I slowly turned my head, wondering what would be there when I looked. In front of a house stood a girl, not much older than 10. She was wearing a blue dress and her hair was in a ponytail. But her face, it didn’t fit the girl. Her face looked more like it belonged to a man of 70, rather than a girl of 10. It was a bit wrinkly and her nose was long. Her eyes though were what made my blood freeze in my veins. They were way too big to fit her face, round and completely black. I stood there frozen, not able to move my body.</p> <p>I wanted to scream, but nothing came out. I felt dizzy and was about to faint when a man appeared behind her. He was about 50 years old and was wearing a black robe. The most disturbing thing was though, that he had the exact same face as the girl. He put his hand on her shoulder and for a moment the two of them just stood there watching me. Then he bent down and whispered something in her ear and walked away. The girl smiled the creepiest smile I could ever imagine, waved at me and then walked away. When she was gone, everything came to life again. I could hear cars in the distance and the wind made the leaves stir and I could even see a cat walking out of a nearby garden. I ran the rest of the way home and didn’t dare to look back. </p> <p>P.s. I&#39;m sorry if my grammar is bad, English isn&#39;t my first language. :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/minna92"> minna92 </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12nwoy/the_family/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12nwoy/the_family/">[13 comments]</a>
===The Cave===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To start off, I dont know exactly what had happened but this story is what i feel happened. I could feel that this story just came to me most likely from the cave and I&#39;d like to share it with this community. by the way this all happened when i was around 17. In respect to my uncles name he will be called James. James loved going spelunking and often adventured into caves ever since a young age. Just being in the dark silence would give him peace. He eventually began to work for some geologists by getting samples of rock from within the caves. He went to one cave he was looking forward to explore for a while which had a large mouth opening at the beginning. He parked his car near the opening, I fell asleep on the way up. He decided not to bother my slumber and promised himself he&#39;d only go in a little ways. He mused that the only companion he would need for that small a hike would be his dog. He trekked in with his gear all loaded up i.e drills, chisels, and tubes. (geologist samples) His dog bounded along his side. As he went in deeper he began to become engrossed in the cave exploring deeper and farther. He made little cairns along his way so he could find his way back. He finally found a good resting point and unloaded some of his gear. He got his drill ready and started making his way into the rock. Right around when half the bit was in the rock he heard this shriek that could be well heard over the drill. He immediately stopped, pulled the drill out and stared at the wall with a confused face. He looked around the cave to find where his dog had gone. It was no where in sight and after screaming its name he assumed it just went to water some friendly looking rocks. He resumed drilling and around 3/4 of the drill bit in he heard the screech. This time he must&#39;ve flipped out, left some of his stuff in a hurry and booked it. He seemed to be running away from this presence. He made it outside the cave where I had been waiting, it was now around dusk and I saw James running out of the cave. I could see he got about 50 feet out of the tunnel until I could see that some rope on his backpack yanked back tight. James flew back made eye contact with me and screamed as he was pulled back into the caves. His face was bloody. I can still hear the scream some nights. I was mortified and drove out as fast as I could. Something in his eyes told me to run. I never stopped til I got home and cried in my mothers arm realying the story of what had just become of Uncle James. I&#39;ve been to that cave again now and have felt a presence... a kind of gravitational pull. I will never go in. I wont be tempted after seeing what it did to my uncle. It may all be tall tale to you but I know its real and whatever is in that cave ...doesn&#39;t like visitors.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Sandstealer456"> Sandstealer456 </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12pu2h/the_cave/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12pu2h/the_cave/">[3 comments]</a>
===The Anti-Christ...===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what this was but I&#39;m going to describe the incident as it happened and you can tell me what it was if you can.</p> <p>So one night, a few years ago, I awoke in bed. I just laid there till I was fully awake because I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep for whatever reason. Suddenly I noticed something in the corner of my eye. There was a man in a suit, standing in the corner of the room, right in front of my door and facing my direction. I sit up and just stare at him for about 3 or 4 seconds. He suddenly lifts his arm and points at me. He says &quot;You will be the Anti-Christ&quot;. His lips were moving but I couldn&#39;t hear anything, it&#39;s like he told me through my mind. When I re-evaluated what happened I thought it was a dream because usually I noticed that&#39;s what happens in our own dreams. People in your dreams don&#39;t really make sounds, it always feels like the sounds are coming form your mind as it projects these images to you, rather than actual sound coming a location <em>apart</em> from yours inside your dream. (For me at least) However, I could hear my bed springs and myself shuffling in my bed, so I don&#39;t know. </p> <p>Anyway, back to the story. So he said &quot;You will be the Anti-Christ&quot;, no sound from his mouth, but I could hear what he said in my mind. Now, I noticed he looked like an agent from the Matrix Trilogy. Nice suit, with sunglasses. So at this point, about 5 seconds after he said this and me just staring at this man in utter shock, he projects this weird force towards me very slowly, his arm still pointing at me. It looked almost like an transparent orb or a whiff of thick air. It moved very slowly toward me and I back up against the wall. (my bed was a twin at the time and it was in a corner of the room against a wall) It came right in front of me and disappeared, along with the man. I sat there breathing deeply and still leaning against my wall for about 2 minutes. The time was around 5am. That&#39;s it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/leftboot"> leftboot </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12pspj/the_antichrist/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12pspj/the_antichrist/">[2 comments]</a>
===The Constant Annoyance===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few weeks back I started to notice something nagging at me every time I would surf the internet. It would really pick up when I was on this one site. Well actually it was one specific part of a site. It was where people would write obviously fake scary stories, but for some reason people would respond to them as if it was completely real. Although I enjoyed the scary stories, the fact that people wanted to ask dumb questions like &quot;are you alive?&quot; and such to the &quot;guy who had just fought a demon living in his girlfriend&#39;s mouth&quot; completely ruined the fun time for me. No amount of stupid comments will make the story seem any more real for me, and instead ruin the fun act of telling creepy stories with your friends and getting to discuss them as such. It started to annoy me to no end, so much so that I think I might have to talk about this with a group of people who might be able to answer my burning question : Why the fuck is this dumbass rule in place and enforced so strongly? It almost ruins the genuinely entertaining stories for me. I just want to point out all the holes, inconsistencies, and shortcomings in the author&#39;s story so they can try to find ways to explain them or patch them in future tellings, not role play ghost-Nancy Drew through the internet. It is just so stupid to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/guacamoleMONSTER"> guacamoleMONSTER </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q05e/the_constant_annoyance/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12q05e/the_constant_annoyance/">[comment]</a>
===Garage===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was about ten years old. It was a summer day and I had been with my neighbor all day when we decided to head over to my house. My parents were not home and the only door that was unlocked was my back garage door. We both knew that if we wanted in my house we would have to go through the garage. We both also knew that my garage was...scary. We would always hear noises out there and never went in it without the garage door open. We slowed our breath and walked in. The problem with my garage is that the only light switch was next to the door to the inside of the house, so we would have to walk through the dark. We continued through the pitch dark when, for no reason at all, the lights came on. It took a second for me to register what happend and by the time I did, there was a low rumbling noise. It got louder and louder and finished with an umistakeable lowd bang. As the we heard the bang, the lights went out again. We both screamed and sprinted for the door, tripping and falling a few times because it was dark. When we eventually found our way to the door, i fumbled with the knob and eventually got it open. As I closed it behind me, I caught a glimpse of something. In the small ray of sunlight coming from the window on the back door, I saw a pale, faceless figure. Too pale to be human and short with stumpy legs. Everytime I tell someone this story, they tell me it was just my young imagination, but the image of that being is burned into my brain. I know something was there.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Banjo_"> Banjo_ </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12p6lk/garage/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12p6lk/garage/">[1 comment]</a>
===The movie "The Haunting Hour: Don't Think About It" has had some major effects on my childhood.===
<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Reddit I have a very serious problem. And currently I&#39;ve known that <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a> can&#39;t help me. So I&#39;ve decided to post in <a href="/r/nosleep">/r/nosleep</a> because everything on <a href="/r/nosleep">/r/nosleep</a> is real. Five years ago there was this movie. The name was &quot;The Haunting Hour: Don&#39;t Think About It&quot;. It was a movie about a immortal two headed monster that comes out of your closet if you think about it. It feeds on human flesh and leaves the remains for its spawn. I had gotten extremely freaked out because of that movie because it has given me Chronic Insomnia. And because I have all that time at night it becomes real hard for me to not think about &quot;it&quot;. I&#39;m very scared because I have also noticed that at many times my closet door opens up in the middle of the night. And when it does happen I just hide myself in the little space between my bed and the wall with a can of Mace. This has been happening up until I was twelve. But it has started happening again because I saw a <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> post about the movie. Can anyone relate, answer, or help me solve this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> submitted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/kyperion"> kyperion </a> <br/> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12payb/the_movie_the_haunting_hour_dont_think_about_it/">[link]</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12payb/the_movie_the_haunting_hour_dont_think_about_it/">[5 comments]</a>
