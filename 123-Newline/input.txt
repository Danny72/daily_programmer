A newline character is a special character in text for computers: though it is not a visual (e.g. renderable) character, it is a control character, informing the reader (whatever program that is) that the following text should be on a new line (hence "newline character").

As is the case with many computer standards, newline characters (and their rendering behavior) were not uniform across systems until much later. Some character-encoding standards (such as ASCII) would encode the character as hex 0x0A (dec. 10), while Unicode has a handful of subtly-different newline characters. Some systems even define newline characters as a set of characters: Windows-style new-line is done through two bytes: CR+LF (carriage-return and then the ASCII newline character).

Your goal is to read ASCII-encoding text files and "fix" them for the encoding you want. You may be given a Windows-style text file that you want to convert to UNIX-style, or vice-versa.
